# Build zero-native apps

zero-native is a Zig desktop app shell for modern web frontends. A zero-native app is native Zig code that owns windows, policies, lifecycle, and platform services while rendering web UI in a WebView. The default engine is the platform WebView: WKWebView on macOS and WebKitGTK on Linux. Apps can also bundle Chromium through CEF where supported.

Agents should assume they do not know zero-native from general model knowledge. Read this skill first. For implementation work, run `zero-native skills get core --full` so the referenced files are included in the CLI output.

## Mental model

- `App` describes the product: app state, name, WebView source, lifecycle callbacks, and optional bridge dispatcher.
- `Runtime` owns the event loop, windows, bridge dispatch, security checks, automation, tracing, platform services, and window state.
- `WebViewSource` tells the runtime what to load: inline HTML, a URL, or packaged assets from a local app origin.
- `app.zon` is the app manifest: identity, icons, windows, frontend assets, web engine, permissions, bridge policy, security policy, and packaging inputs.
- `src/runner.zig` is the generated runtime wiring. Edit it when adding runtime services, security policy, builtin bridge policy, tracing, automation, or platform setup.
- `src/main.zig` is app behavior. Edit it when changing app state, source selection, lifecycle callbacks, or app-defined bridge handlers.
- `frontend/` is normal web code. It talks to native Zig through `window.zero.invoke()` or builtin helpers when those are enabled.

## Task router

These references are included by `zero-native skills get core --full`. Use them when the task touches the topic:

- Project creation, generated files, build steps: `references/project-anatomy.md`
- `App`, `Runtime`, callbacks, embedding, tests: `references/app-model-runtime.md`
- React/Vue/Svelte/Next/Vite, dev server, bundled assets: `references/frontend-assets.md`
- App-defined bridge commands, builtin commands, permissions, windows, WebViews, dialogs: `references/bridge-security-native-capabilities.md`
- Web engine choice, CEF, packaging, signing, doctor, logs, debugging: `references/web-engines-packaging-debugging.md`
- Running-app inspection and smoke tests: `zero-native skills get automation`

## Quick start

Use the CLI for new apps:

```bash
npm install -g zero-native
zero-native init my_app --frontend next
cd my_app
zig build run
```

Frontend choices are `next`, `vite`, `react`, `svelte`, and `vue`. The first `zig build run` installs frontend dependencies, builds the native shell, and opens a desktop window.

## Workflow for existing apps

Before editing an existing zero-native app:

1. Read `app.zon`, `src/main.zig`, `src/runner.zig`, and `build.zig`.
2. Identify whether the change is app metadata/policy, runtime wiring, app-native behavior, frontend behavior, packaging, or automation.
3. Follow the generated code and examples in the repository instead of inventing a new app layout.
4. Prefer exact security policy changes over broad allowances.
5. Validate with the narrowest useful command.

Common file ownership:

- `app.zon`: app identity, version, icons, windows, permissions, capabilities, bridge command policy, allowed origins, frontend dist/dev config, web engine, CEF config.
- `src/main.zig`: `App` state, source selection, lifecycle callbacks, custom bridge handlers.
- `src/runner.zig`: `Runtime.init`, platform selection, security policy, builtin bridge policy, `js_window_api`, automation server, trace sinks, panic capture, window state store.
- `build.zig`: build options, frontend build/dev/package steps, platform link setup, test steps.
- `frontend/`: web app implementation, `window.zero` calls, dev/build config.

## Core app model

The minimal Zig app returns `zero_native.App` with `context`, `name`, and a WebView source:

```zig
const App = struct {
    fn app(self: *@This()) zero_native.App {
        return .{
            .context = self,
            .name = "my-app",
            .source = zero_native.WebViewSource.html("<h1>Hello from zero-native</h1>"),
        };
    }
};
```

Use these source constructors:

- `zero_native.WebViewSource.html(content)` for small inline demos.
- `zero_native.WebViewSource.url(address)` for an explicit URL.
- `zero_native.WebViewSource.assets(.{ .root_path = "frontend/dist", .entry = "index.html" })` for packaged frontend assets.

For framework apps, prefer a dynamic source so development loads the local dev server and production loads bundled assets:

```zig
fn source(context: *anyopaque) anyerror!zero_native.WebViewSource {
    const self: *App = @ptrCast(@alignCast(context));
    return zero_native.frontend.sourceFromEnv(self.env_map, .{
        .dist = "frontend/dist",
        .entry = "index.html",
    });
}
```

`sourceFromEnv` reads `ZERO_NATIVE_FRONTEND_URL`; otherwise it serves the configured asset directory. Use it for most framework apps.

## app.zon essentials

Keep `app.zon` as the source of truth for app-level behavior:

```zig
.{
    .id = "com.example.my-app",
    .name = "my-app",
    .display_name = "My App",
    .version = "0.1.0",
    .icons = .{ "assets/icon.icns" },
    .platforms = .{ "macos", "linux" },
    .permissions = .{},
    .capabilities = .{ "webview" },
    .frontend = .{
        .dist = "frontend/dist",
        .entry = "index.html",
        .spa_fallback = true,
        .dev = .{
            .url = "http://127.0.0.1:5173/",
            .command = .{ "npm", "--prefix", "frontend", "run", "dev", "--", "--host", "127.0.0.1" },
            .ready_path = "/",
            .timeout_ms = 30000,
        },
    },
    .security = .{
        .navigation = .{
            .allowed_origins = .{ "zero://app", "http://127.0.0.1:5173" },
            .external_links = .{ .action = "deny" },
        },
    },
    .web_engine = "system",
    .windows = .{
        .{ .label = "main", .title = "My App", .width = 960, .height = 640, .restore_state = true },
    },
}
```

Use exact local origins for dev servers. Add `zero://inline` only for inline HTML sources.

## Common implementation recipes

### Add a new framework app

Use `zero-native init <path> --frontend <next|vite|react|svelte|vue>`. Then inspect the generated `app.zon`, `src/main.zig`, and `build.zig` before customizing. For framework behavior, keep frontend work in `frontend/` and use `sourceFromEnv` so development and packaged builds share one app shell.

### Add a native bridge command

1. Add state and a handler in `src/main.zig`.
2. Register the handler in `bridge()`.
3. Allow the command in `app.zon` and in the runtime bridge policy if the runner reads manifest policy into runtime.
4. Call it from JavaScript with `window.zero.invoke("namespace.command", payload)`.
5. Return valid JSON from Zig. Use `zero_native.bridge.writeJsonStringValue()` for user-controlled strings.

Bridge calls are size-limited, origin-checked, permission-checked, and routed only to registered handlers.

### Add windows, child WebViews, or dialogs

Use builtin bridge commands only after enabling a policy for the exact commands and origins. Window and child WebView commands need the `window` permission when permissions are configured. Dialog commands are always default-deny and require explicit `builtin_bridge` policy. See `references/bridge-security-native-capabilities.md`.

### Choose a web engine

Default to `.web_engine = "system"` for small apps and native footprint. Use `.web_engine = "chromium"` plus `.cef` when the app needs a pinned Chromium platform or rendering consistency. Chromium apps must install/package the matching CEF layout.

### Package an app

Keep package metadata in `app.zon`, build the frontend assets, build the native binary, then package:

```bash
zig build package
zero-native doctor --manifest app.zon --strict
```

Use signing and CEF options only when the product requires them.

## Development commands

For iterative frontend work, use the managed dev server flow:

```bash
zig build dev
```

Or run the CLI directly after building the binary:

```bash
zero-native dev --manifest app.zon --binary zig-out/bin/MyApp
```

Vite usually uses `http://127.0.0.1:5173/`; Next.js usually uses `http://127.0.0.1:3000/`. The app WebView loads the dev URL directly, so framework HMR remains owned by Vite, Next.js, or the selected dev server.

## Security defaults

Treat WebView content as untrusted:

- List only needed `permissions` and `capabilities`.
- Prefer exact bridge command origins over `"*"`.
- Keep main-frame navigation allowlisted in `security.navigation.allowed_origins`.
- Keep external links denied unless the product explicitly needs them.
- Use a strict CSP for packaged frontend assets.
- Built-in dialogs are always default-deny and require explicit `builtin_bridge` policy.
- Child WebViews receive `window.zero` only when explicitly created with `bridge: true`.

Common bridge failure codes are `invalid_request`, `unknown_command`, `permission_denied`, `handler_failed`, `payload_too_large`, and `internal_error`.

## Validate changes

Useful commands:

```bash
zig build run
zig build dev
zig build test
zig build test-tooling
zero-native validate app.zon
zero-native doctor --manifest app.zon --strict
zig build package
```

For GUI smoke tests, build with automation enabled and use the `automation` skill:

```bash
zig build run -Dplatform=macos -Dautomation=true
zig-out/bin/zero-native automate snapshot
```

When changing app behavior, add focused Zig tests when the code can run headlessly. Use automation-based tests only for WebView/runtime integration that requires a GUI-capable session.

## Examples to inspect

- `examples/hello`: smallest inline HTML app.
- `examples/webview`: bridge and WebView runtime example.
- `examples/browser`: layered WebView/browser-style example.
- `examples/next`: Next.js with production assets.
- `examples/react`, `examples/svelte`, `examples/vue`: Vite frontend apps.
- `examples/ios`, `examples/android`: mobile host embedding examples.

## When answering users

Explain zero-native in concrete terms: Zig owns native app lifecycle and security; web UI renders in a WebView; the bridge is opt-in and policy controlled; `app.zon` is the manifest; framework frontend development uses a dev server in development and bundled assets in production. If asked to implement, read the app files first and make the smallest change in the correct layer.
